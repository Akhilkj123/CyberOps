**Objectives**

Understand vulnerabilities of wireless and other common technologies

Part 1: View the TEDx Video “Top Hacker Shows Us How It’s Done; Pablos Holman at TEDxMidwests”

Part 2: Answer the following questions

a. What is the vulnerability being exploited?
- The person plugs a little device to TV to make it a node on a network which is a infrared transceiver 
which can be used to send codes that TV remote might send.
Using this he can control all the TVs in his hotel room.
- He has a device Hackerbot which drives around the Hotel room and Wi-fi users.
- They made a pistol version of Hackerbot for password sniffing.
- A javascript code was being added into Myspace which automatically adds a person to the attackers 
friends list.

b. What information, data, or control can be gained by a hacker exploiting this vulnerability?
- TV can be controlled by the attacker which can gain information about any person who uses it.
- Hacker bot can grab passwords of the scanned networks
- Pistol version also can sniff passwords to long range
- The javascript code adds any person to the attackers friends list in Myspace

c. How is the hack performed?
- The first hack is performed by using infrared transceiver.
- Hackerbot is a type of robot created by an attacker to sniff password in a specific range.
- A vulnerable javascript has been provided by an attacker which automatically adds up friends list of 
the persons who visits the vulnerable page

d. What about this particular hack interested you specifically?
- A small infrared transceiver can control all TVs of a hotel room, a javascript can add friends list all 
these are because of not proper security system which makes it vulnerable

e. How do you think this particular hack could be mitigated?
- This can be mitigated by providing proper security to the system that is being attacked

### Part 1: Shell Basics
#### Step 1: Access the Command Line

a. Log on to the CyberOps Workstation VM as the analyst using the password cyberops. The account
analyst is used as the example user account throughout this lab.

b. To access the command line, click the terminal icon located in the Dock, at the bottom of VM screen. The
terminal emulator opens.

#### Step 2: Display Manual Pages from the command line.
a. To learn more about the man page, type:

[analyst@secOps ~]$ man man

Question:
Name a few sections that are included in a man page.

b. Type q to exit the man page.

c. Use the man command to learn more about the cp command:

[analyst@secOps ~]$ man cp

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/f886a12b-d086-4f00-b2cf-571bec0004ab)

What is the function of the cp command?
- The cp command is a commonly used command in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and macOS. It is used to copy files and directories from one location to another. The name "cp" stands for "copy."

#### Step 3: Create and change directories.
a. Type pwd at the prompt.

[analyst@secOps ~]$ pwd

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/07855617-5513-4c14-8c5b-c8a931c153fc)

Question:
What is the current directory?
- /home/analyst

b. Navigate to the /home/analyst directory if it is not your current directory. Type cd /home/analyst

[analyst@secOps ~]$ cd /home/analyst

c. Type ls -l at the command prompt to list the files and folders that are in the current folder. Standing for
list, the -l option displays file size, permissions, ownership, date of creation and more.

[analyst@secOps ~]$ ls -l

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/5eef112e-1206-496b-a7c6-7d93e2336cbb)

d. In the current directory, use the mkdir command to create three new folders: cyops_folder1,
cyops_folder2, and cyops_folder3. Type mkdir cyops_folder1 and press Enter. Repeat these steps to
create cyops_folder2 and cyops_folder3

[analyst@secOps ~]$ mkdir cyops_folder1

[analyst@secOps ~]$ mkdir cyops_folder2

[analyst@secOps ~]$ mkdir cyops_folder3

e. Type ls -l to verify that the folders have been created:

[analyst@secOps ~]$ ls -l

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/ba375a91-264e-43f7-9886-4f995f3c2f22)

f. Type cd /home/analyst/cyops_folder3 at the command prompt and press Enter.

[analyst@secOps ~]$ cd /home/analyst/cyops_folder3

Question:
Which folder are you in now?

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/2f2b9954-f3d4-405f-a483-9576984fa1af)

g. Use the mkdir command to create a new folder named cyops_folder4 inside the cyops_folder3 folder:

[analyst@secOps ~]$ mkdir /home/analyst/cyops_folder3/cyops_folder4

h. Use the ls -l command to verify the folder creation.

[analyst@secOps ~]$ ls –l /home/analyst/cyops_folder3

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/bfb335b0-b9df-40a0-aa29-e298b52c82f3)

i. [analyst@secOps ~]$ ls –la /home/analyst/cyops_folder3

j. Change the current directory to /home/analyst/cyops_folder3:

[analyst@secOps ~]$ cd /home/analyst/cyops_folder3

k. Type cd .

[analyst@secOps cyops_folder3]$ cd .

l. Changing the directory to the .. directory, will change to the directory that is one level up. This directory is
also known as parent directory. Type cd ..

[analyst@secOps cyops_folder3]$ cd ..

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/48f1a336-cbcd-41ef-bbaf-5cca770f7b27)

What happens?
What would be the current directory if you issued the cd .. command at [analyst@secOps ~]$?

What would be the current directory if you issued the cd .. command at [analyst@secOps home]$?

What would be the current directory if you issued the cd .. command at [analyst@secOps /]$?

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/799370aa-1a1c-4a40-8bc6-4096642bdbc8)

#### Step 4: Redirect Outputs.

a. Use the cd command to change to the /home/analyst/ (~) directory:

[analyst@secOps /]$ cd /home/analyst/

b. Use the echo command to echo a message. Because no output was defined, echo will output to the
current terminal window:

[analyst@secOps ~]$ echo This is a message echoed to the terminal by echo.

c. Use the > operator to redirect the output of echo to a text file instead of to the screen:

[analyst@secOps ~]$ echo This is a message echoed to the terminal by echo. >
some_text_file.txt

Question:
Is that expected? Explain.

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/fe6802e0-9b16-4025-8457-4e683a56a75a)

d. Notice, that even though the some_text_file.txt file did not exist, prior to the echo command, it was
automatically created to receive the output generated by echo. Use the ls -l command to verify if the file
was really created:

[analyst@secOps ~]$ ls –l some_text_file.txt

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/5043f3f2-3b33-496a-a3f9-b51b679a9648)

e. Use the cat command to display the contents of the some_text_file.txt text file:

[analyst@secOps ~]$ cat some_text_file.txt

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/b78a7231-e802-4293-967f-77ab4555f1a7)

f. Use the > operator again to redirect a different echo output of echo to the some_text_file.txt text file:

[analyst@secOps ~]$ echo This is a DIFFERENT message, once again echoed to the
terminal by echo. > some_text_file.txt

g. Once again, use the cat command to display the contents of the some_text_file.txt text file:

[analyst@secOps ~]$ cat some_text_file.txt

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/e7d1df51-19e9-4d42-b0e9-18fb7363c5e2)

#### Step 5: Redirect and Append to a Text File.

a. [analyst@secOps ~]$ echo This is another line of text. It will be APPENDED to the output file. >> some_text_file.txt
 
 b. Use the cat command to display the contents of the some_text_file.txt text file yet again:

[analyst@secOps ~]$ cat some_text_file.txt

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/f20ad288-9088-4473-b424-a25d4a36b032)

#### Step 6: Work with hidden files in Linux.
a. In Linux, files with names that begin with a ‘.’ (single dot) are not shown by default. While dot-files have
nothing else special about them, they are called hidden files because of this feature. Examples of hidden
files are .file5, .file6, .file7.
Note: Do not confuse dot-files with the current directory indicator “.” symbol. Hidden file names begin with
a dot (period), followed by more characters while the dot directory is a hidden directory comprised of only
a single dot.

b. Use ls -l to display the files stored in the analyst home directory.

[analyst@secOps ~]$ ls –l

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/6524ced2-e574-40d2-9f88-8bc7a9ae09c7)

Question:
How many files are displayed?

c. Use the ls -la command to display all files in the home directory of analyst, including the hidden files.

[analyst@secOps ~]$ ls –la

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/443f0391-af6d-43fe-adb2-4242e64011c1)

Questions:
How many more files are displayed than before? Explain.

d. Type the man ls command at the prompt to learn more about the ls command.

[analyst@secOps ~]$ man ls

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/d3abb778-cecd-46d0-ae8d-96d7d80fdf90)

### Part 2: Copying, Deleting, and Moving Files
#### Step 1: Copying Files
a. [analyst@secOps ~]$ cp some_text_file.txt cyops_folder2/

Identify the parameters in the cp command above.

Question:
What are the source and destination files?

b. Use the ls command to verify that some_text_file.txt is now in cyops_folder2:

[analyst@secOps ~]$ ls cyops_folder2/

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/b6c1028c-d670-4ea0-a132-769e121e4862)

c. Use the ls command to verify that some_text_file.txt is also in the home directory:

[analyst@secOps ~]$ ls -l

#### Step 2: Deleting Files and Directories
a. Use the rm command to remove files. Issue the command below to remove the file some_text_file.txt
from the home directory. The ls command is then used to show that the file some_text_file.txt has been
removed from the home directory:

[analyst@secOps ~]$ rm some_text_file.txt

[analyst@secOps ~]$ ls -l

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/49c11af0-667e-493b-80a2-c13ed59ff558)

b. [analyst@secOps ~]$ rm –r cyops_folder1

[analyst@secOps ~]$ ls -l

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/5f423edd-96e5-4e8c-ace1-8f0dfe22e1e1)

#### Step 3: Moving Files and Directories
a. [analyst@secOps ~]$ mv cyops_folder2/some_text_file.txt .

[analyst@secOps ~]$ ls –l cyops_folder2/

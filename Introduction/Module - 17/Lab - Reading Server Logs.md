## Part 1: Reading Log Files with Cat, More, Less, and Tail
### Step 1: Opening Log Files.
a. Start the CyberOps Worstation VM and open a terminal window.

b. From the terminal window, issue the command below to display the contents of the logstash-tutorial.log
file, located in the /home/analyst/lab.support.files/ folder:

What is a drawback of using cat with large text files?
- Using cat with large text files can consume excessive memory, slow down our system, and lack interactive features compared to more suitable tools like less or text editors.

c. From the same terminal window, use the command below to display the contents of the logstashtutorial.log file again. This time using more:

What is the drawback of using more?
- It may not be as feature-rich or user-friendly as some alternative tools like less or graphical text editors, which offer better interactivity, search capabilities, and backward navigation when viewing large text files.

d. From the same terminal window, use less to display the contents the logstash-tutorial.log file again:

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/a608c1e4-8373-4722-99e2-3634e9504dc3)

e. The tail command displays the end of a text file. By default, tail displays the last ten lines of the file.
Use tail to display the last ten lines of the /home/analyst/lab.support.files/logstash-tutorial.log file.

### Step 2: Actively Following Logs.
a. Use tail -f to actively monitor the contents of the /var/log/syslog file:

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/a2c7f12d-5b66-4479-870b-74d7d37a5298)

What is different in the output of tail and tail -f? Explain.
- The key difference is that tail provides a static view of the last few lines of a file and exits, while tail -f allows us to actively monitor a file and see updates in real-time as new data is added to the file.

To watch tail â€“f in action, open a second terminal window. Arrange your display so you can see both
terminal windows. Re-size the windows so you can see them both at the same, as shown in the image
below:

c. Select the bottom terminal window and enter the following command:

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/054db66d-7a90-4181-8a4b-c5496bd0755d)

d. Press CTRL + C to stop the execution of tail -f and return to the shell prompt.

e. Close one of the two terminal windows.

## Part 2: Log Files and Syslog
a. Use the cat command as root to list the contents of the /var/log/syslog.1 file. This file holds the log
entries that are generated by the CyberOps Workstation VM operating system and sent to the syslog
service.

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/bf502ea6-7704-485e-9deb-3ef54a13b0ca)
![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/7f83ed73-73f1-476e-af46-9ae4e32deec0)

Why did the cat command have to be executed as root?
- We are accessing a file or folder which does not have permission for normal user access.

b. Notice that the /var/log/syslog file only stores the most recent log entries. To keep the syslog file small,
the operating system periodically rotates the log files, renaming older log files as syslog.1, syslog.2, and
so on.

Use the cat command to list older syslog files:

Can you think of a reason why it is so important to keep the time and date of computers correctly
synchronized?
- So they can be easily analysed when required based on the correct date and time.

## Part 3: Log Files and Journalctl
### Step 1: Running journalctl with no options.
a. To look at the journald logs, use the journalctl command. The journalctl tool interprets and displays the
log entries previously stored in the journal binary log files.

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/e232536c-8bd4-48f8-842e-748564f548ad)

b. Use CTRL+C to exit the display.
### Step 2: Journalctl and a few options.
a. Use journalctl --utc to display all timestamps in UTC time:

b. Use journalctl -b to display log entries recorded during the last boot:

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/c913c2a0-a89b-4380-9794-386bd34d6ed1)

c. Use journalctl to specify the service and timeframe for log entries. The command below shows all nginx
service logs recorded today:

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/3a4deda3-d203-4bf2-a959-bbd5ca6c953b)

d. Use the -k switch to display only messages generated by the kernel:

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/181b05d4-8ff6-42bd-a078-233d9669f0d1)

e. Similar to tail -f described above, use the -f switch to actively follow the logs as they are being written:

![image](https://github.com/Akhilkj123/CyberOps/assets/65653010/3e10ae2a-9cc1-4e51-859c-c2d52e014ce8)

Compare Syslog and Journald. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
- Syslog is a legacy standard with flexibility and network support, while Journald offers structured data, rich metadata, and reliable storage but is tied to systemd and has limited portability.

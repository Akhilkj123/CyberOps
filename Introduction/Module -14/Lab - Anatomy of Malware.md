a) Using your favorite search engine, conduct a search for recent malware. During your search, choose four examples of malware, each one from a different malware type, and be prepared to discuss details on
what each does, how it each is transmitted and the impact each cause. Examples of malware types include: Ransomware, Trojan, Hoax, Adware, Malware, PUP, Exploit, Exploit Kit and Vulnerability. Search for malware by visiting the following websites using the following search
terms:
- **Fleckpe Malware** - When a Fleckpe app launches, it decodes a hidden payload that contains malicious code, which is then executed. This payload is responsible for contacting the threat actor's command and control (C2) server to send basic information about the newly infected device, including the MCC (Mobile Country Code) and MNC (Mobile Network Code). The C2 responds with a website address which the trojan opens in an invisible web browser window and subscribes the victim to a premium service. If a confirmation code needs to be entered, the malware will retrieve it from the device's notifications and submit it on the hidden screen to finalize the subscription.
- **New Android FluHorse malware** - FluHorse attacks begin with malicious emails sent to high-profile targets, urging them to take immediate action to resolve a payment issue. Typically, the victim is led to a phishing site via a link provided in the email, where they download the fake app APK (Android package file) from. The apps mimicked by the FluHorse carrier apps are 'ETC,' a toll-collection app used in Taiwan, and 'VPBank Neo,' a banking app in Vietnam. Both legitimate versions of these apps have over a million downloads each on Google Play.
- **New Cactus ransomware** - there are three main modes of execution, each one selected with the use of a specific command line switch: setup (-s), read configuration (-r), and encryption (-i). The -s and -r arguments allow the threat actors to setup persistence and store data in a C:\ProgramData\ntuser.dat file that is later read by the encryptor when running with the -r command line argument. For the file encryption to be possible, though, a unique AES key known only to the attackers must be provided using the -i command line argument. This key is necessary to decrypt the ransomware's configuration file and the public RSA key needed to encrypt files. It is available as a HEX string hardcoded in the encryptor binary.
- **Akira ransomware** - When executed, Akira will delete Windows Shadow Volume Copies on the device by running PowerShell command. The ransomware will then proceed to encrypt files. While encrypting, the encryptor will skip files found in the Recycle Bin, System Volume Information, Boot, ProgramData, and Windows folders. It will also avoid encrypting the Windows system files with .exe, .lnk, .dll, .msi, and .sys file extensions. When encrypting files, the ransomware encrypts files and appends the .akira extension will be appended to the file's name. Each computer folder will contain a ransom note named akira_readme.txt  that includes information on what happened to a victim's files and links to the Akira data leak site and negotiation site.

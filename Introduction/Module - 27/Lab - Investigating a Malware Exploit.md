## Part 1: Use Kibana to Learn About a Malware Exploit
### Step 1: Narrow the timeframe.
a. Login to Security Onion with the analyst username and cyberops password.

b. Open Kibana (username analyst and password cyberops) and set an Absolute time range to narrow the
focus to log data from January 2017.

c. You will see a graph appear with a single entry showing. To view more details, you need to narrow the
amount of time that is displayed. Narrow the time range in the Total Log Count Over Time visualization by clicking and dragging to select an area around the graph data point. You may need to repeat this process
until you see some detail in the graph.

### Step 2: Locate the Event in Kibana
a. After narrowing the time range in the main Kibana dashboard, go to the NIDS Alert Data dashboard by
clicking NIDS.

b. Zoom in on the event by clicking and dragging in the NIDS â€“ Alerts Over Time visualization further focus
in on the event timeframe. Since the event happened over a very short period of time, select just the
graph plot line. Zoom in until your display resembles the one below.

c. Click the first point on the timeline to filter for only that first event.

d. Now view details for the events that occurred at that time. Scroll all the way to the bottom of the
dashboard until you see the NIDS Alerts section of the page. The alerts are arranged by time. Expand
the first event in the list by clicking the pointer arrow that is to the left of the timestamp.

f. In a web browser on a computer that can connect to the internet, go to the link that is provided in the
signature_info field of the alert. This will take you to the Emerging Threats Snort alert rule for the exploit.
There are a series of rules shown. This is because signatures can change over time, or new and more
accurate rules are developed. The newest rule is at the top of the page. Examine details of the rule.

What is Nmap? What is nmap used for?
- Nmap, short for Network Mapper, is a free and open source tool used for vulnerability checking, port scanning and, of course, network mapping.

d. While in the man page, you can use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through the pages. You can
also press the space bar to forward one page at a time.
To search for a specific term or phrase use enter a forward slash (/) or question mark (?) followed by the
term or phrase. The forward slash searches forward through the document, and the question mark
searches backward through the document. The key n moves to the next match.
Type /example and press ENTER. This will search for the word example forward through the man page.

e. In the first instance of example, you see three matches. To move to the next match, press n.
